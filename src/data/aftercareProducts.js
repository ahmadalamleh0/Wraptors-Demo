// Aftercare product catalogue — the single source of truth for the
// "Don't Forget the Aftercare" section shared across every service page
// (see AftercareSection.jsx). Only real Wraptors store products live
// here; no invented items, prices or claims.
//
// AFTERCARE_BY_SERVICE controls which products show up on which service
// page. For now every service shows the same three products, for
// consistency across pages — swap in service-specific product ids later
// (per service, if the catalogue grows) without touching AftercareSection.
